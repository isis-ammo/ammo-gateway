==Usage===
To run the core gateway and Android plugin:

   1) export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<gateway_release_location>/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   2) Run from the extracted location (the GatewayCore must be started before 
      plugins):
        a) ./GatewayCore
        b) ./AndroidGatewayPlugin
   3) If you are running in the online mode (network enabled on the Android 
      devices), then please run the CoreApplication on Android and set the IP 
      address to point to the machine where your AndroidPlugin is running, and 
      the port to: 33289
   4) If you are running in the offline mode â€“ then please mount the device SD 
      card on the laptop where the Gateway is running (or any node with network 
      access to Gateway), and the run the GatewayUsbTransfer script in the 
      gateway install directory, like so:
        ./GatewayUsbTransfer <sdcard-path> <host>   <port>
           * Note that sdcard path is the path to the sdcard (i.e. 
             /media/SERIAL_NO, for current versions of Ubuntu), not to the 
             actual file or directory in the sdcard where journal files are 
             stored.
