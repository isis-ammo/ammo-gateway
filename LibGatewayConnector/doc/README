This directory contains the configuration files for the Doxygen
documentation for the GatewayConnector library.

Requirements:
* doxygen (1.7.1 or later)
* graphviz/dot (2.26.3 or later) to generate nice diagrams
* latex (preferably TeXLive 2010, although other distributions
  may work)

Build instructions:
* Run 'doxygen' in this directory (no arguments).  HTML 
  documentation will be generated in the html/ subdirectory;
  its index will be at 'html/index.html'.
* Build PDF documentation by running 'doxygen', changing to the 
  latex/ subdirectory, and running 'make'.  Output will be found
  in 'latex/refman.pdf'.
