The AndroidConnector module is now an installable Python package, to allow it to
be reused without having to copy code around a lot of different places (or set
Python's PATH in every script that uses it).

Installation on Ubuntu (the version of Twisted in Ubuntu's repository is out of
date):

1) Install python-setuptools and python-dev:
     sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev
     
2) Install AndroidConnector:
     cd AndroidConnector
     sudo ./setup.py install
     
You will need to reinstall AndroidConnector if it changes, or if
AmmoMessages.proto changes.

---

To run the non-AndroidConnector based testdrivers in this directory, you'll need
to build AmmoMessages.proto.  You can do this by running 'make' in this
directory.
