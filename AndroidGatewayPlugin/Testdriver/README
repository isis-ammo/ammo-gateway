The AndroidConnector module is now an installable Python package, to allow it to
be reused without having to copy code around a lot of different places (or set
Python's PATH in every script that uses it).

** Installation on Ubuntu (the version of Twisted in Ubuntu's repository is out
of date):

1) Install python-setuptools and python-dev:
     sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev
     
2) Install AndroidConnector:
     cd AndroidConnector
     sudo ./setup.py install
     
You will need to reinstall AndroidConnector if it changes, or if
AmmoMessages.proto changes.

** Installation on Windows (assuming the Gateway build environment is already
configured):

1) Download and install Python 2.7 (32-bit or 64-bit should work, but remember
   which one you've installed):
     http://python.org/download/
     
3) Put python in your PATH.  Add (changing C:\python27 to your Python install
   directory if necessary):
     C:\python27;C:\python27\Scripts
     
2) Download and install Twisted (make sure it matches your installed Python
   version):
     http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/Downloads
     
3) Download and install python-setuptools:
     http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
   (note that the install instructions for 64-bit and 32-bit versions of Python
   are different)
   
4) Download and install the Python protobuf API:
     1. Download and extract http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/detail?name=protobuf-2.3.0.zip
     2. In a command prompt window, go to {location you extracted protobuf)\protobuf
     3. In that directory, run:
           python setup.py install (may need to be an administrator for this
                                    command to work)

5) Install AndroidConnector:
     cd %GATEWAY_ROOT%\AndroidGatewayPlugin\Testdriver\AndroidConnector
     python setup.py install (may need to run command prompt as an administrator)

---

To run the non-AndroidConnector based testdrivers in this directory, you'll need
to build AmmoMessages.proto.  You can do this by running 'make' in this
directory.
