The AndroidConnector module (and scripts dependent on it, including Consumer.py
and Producer.py) requires Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/).

Installation on Ubuntu (the version of Twisted in Ubuntu's repository is out of
date):

1) Install python-setuptools and python-dev:
     sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev
     
2) Install twisted:
     sudo easy_install twisted
     
3) Build the protocol buffers generated code:
     make
   (from inside this directory)
