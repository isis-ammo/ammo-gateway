Build prerequisites (tested version):
  * Google Protocol Buffers (2.3.0)
  * ACE (5.8.3)
  * Perl (Linux: 5.10.1, Windows 5.12.1)
  * Gsoap (2.7.17)
  * Boost C++ Libraries (1.42)
  * libcurl (OpenSSL) (7.2.1)
  
Building on Linux:
==================
  1) Install build dependencies using your distribution's package manager.  See
     manifest.dpkg for a list of required packages.
     
     On Ubuntu, these can be installed in one step with:
        sudo apt-get install $(cat manifest.dpkg)
     
  2) Download, build, and install Google Protocol Buffers
     ** Note:  on Ubuntu 10.04, Protocol Buffers 2.3.0 may conflict with an
        earlier version of Protocol Buffers already on the system-- you may
        want to install it to a different prefix with
        
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/protobuf230/
        
        or similar to avoid causing system-wide conflicts.
        
     ** Ubuntu 10.10 ships with Protocol Buffers 2.3.0, so you should not
        build and install it from source (it was installed in Step 1).
        
  3) Download, build, and install gsoap, version 2.7.17, available at:
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/files/gSOAP/gsoap_2.7.17.zip/download
        
        Note that this is an older version of gsoap--  but it's newer than the
        version available in Ubuntu 10.04 or 10.10's repositories.  Build using
        the standard Linux:
          ./configure
          make
          sudo make install
        
  4) Download and extract ACE+TAO+CIAO to a location of your choice.
        http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/
        e.g.
        http://download.dre.vanderbilt.edu/previous_versions/ACE+TAO+CIAO-5.8.3.tar.bz2
  
  5) Set environment variables (in .bashrc or similar):
        export ACE_ROOT=(ACE_wrappers directory)
        export MPC_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/MPC
        export TAO_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/TAO
        export CIAO_ROOT=$TAO_ROOT/CIAO
        export PROTOBUF_ROOT=(Protobuf installation directory)
        export GATEWAY_ROOT=(This Gateway directory)
        export PATH=$PROTOBUF_ROOT/bin:$ACE_ROOT/bin:$PATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GATEWAY_ROOT/build/lib:$PROTOBUF_ROOT/lib:$ACE_ROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  
  6) Create a file called "config.h" in $ACE_ROOT/ace/ containing:
        #define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY 1
        #include "ace/config-linux.h"
        
  7) Create a symbolic link called platform_macros.GNU in $ACE_ROOT/include/makeinclude
     pointing to the file platform_linux.GNU
     i.e. ln -s platform_linux.GNU platform_macros.GNU
     (If platform_macros.GNU already exists you will need to remove it.)
        
  8) Build ACE (you may also build TAO and CIAO at this point, but they are not
     currently required for the gateway):
        cd $ACE_ROOT
        make
        
  9) Generate Gateway workspace:
        mwc.pl --type make Gateway.mwc
        
 10) Build the gateway:
        make
        
  Linux build notes:
   * Compiled executables can be found in $GATEWAY_ROOT/build/bin/; note that
     executables should also be run from this directory so that they can find
     their configuration files.
   * Generated object files may be cleaned with 'make clean'; all generated
     files (including executables and C++ files generated by the Protocol
     Buffers compiler) may be cleaned with 'make realclean'.
     
Building on Windows (Visual Studio 2008)
========================================
  ** For ease of compilation, a precompiled copy of Protocol Buffers is provided
     in the code repository.

  1) Download ACE+TAO+CIAO and extract
  
  2) Set environment variables (in System Properties):
        ACE_ROOT = (ACE_wrappers directory)
        MPC_ROOT = %ACE_ROOT%\MPC
        TAO_ROOT = %ACE_ROOT%\TAO
        CIAO_ROOT = %TAO_ROOT%\CIAO
        PROTOBUF_ROOT = (protobuf-2.3.0-win-i386\ directory within your Git working directory)
        GATEWAY_ROOT = (this Gateway directory)
        PATH = %PROTOBUF_ROOT%\bin;%ACE_ROOT%\bin;%ACE_ROOT%\lib;%GATEWAY_ROOT%\build\lib
        
        (After setting environment variables, any open command prompts or Visual
        Studio instances must be restarted for changes to take effect.)
        
  3) Create a file called 'config.h' in %ACE_ROOT%/ace/ containing:
        #define ACE_HAS_STANDARD_CPP_LIBRARY 1
        #include "ace/config-win32.h"
        
  4) Build ACE (you may also build TAO and CIAO at this point, but they are not
     currently required for the gateway):
        Open ACE_wrappers_vc9.sln from within the ACE_wrappers folder and build.
        
  5) If not already installed, download and install perl for Windows.  The DOC
     group recommends ActiveState ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl)
     
  6) Generate the Gateway workspace:
       %ACE_ROOT%\bin\mwc.pl --type vc9 Gateway.mwc
       
  7) Build the gateway:
      Open Gateway.sln in Visual Studio and build.
