Build prerequisites (tested version):
  * ACE (5.8.1)
  * Google Protocol Buffers (2.3.0)
  * Perl (Linux: 5.10.1, Windows 5.12.1)
  
Building on Linux:
==================
  1) Download, build, and install Google Protocol Buffers
     ** Note:  on Ubuntu 10.04, Protocol Buffers 2.3.0 may conflict with an
        earlier version of Protocol Buffers already on the system-- you may
        want to install it to a different prefix with
        
        ./configure --prefix=$HOME/protobuf230/
        
        or similar to avoid causing system-wide conflicts.
  2) Download ACE+TAO+CIAO and extract
  
  3) Set environment variables (in .bashrc or similar):
        export ACE_ROOT=(ACE_wrappers directory)
        export MPC_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/MPC
        export TAO_ROOT=$ACE_ROOT/TAO
        export CIAO_ROOT=$TAO_ROOT/CIAO
        export PROTOBUF_ROOT=(Protobuf installation directory)
        export PATH=$PROTOBUF_ROOT/bin:$ACE_ROOT/bin:$PATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PROTOBUF_ROOT/lib:$ACE_ROOT/lib
        
  4) Build ACE (you may also build TAO and CIAO at this point, but they are not
     currently required for the gateway):
        cd $ACE_ROOT
        make
        
  5) Generate Gateway workspace:
        mwc.pl --type make Gateway.mwc
        
  6) Build the gateway:
        make
        
  Linux build notes:
   * Generated object files may be cleaned with 'make clean'; all generated
     files (including executables and C++ files generated by the Protocol
     Buffers compiler) may be cleaned with 'make realclean'.
     
Building on Windows (Visual Studio 2008)
========================================
  ** For ease of compilation, a precompiled copy of Protocol Buffers is provided
     in the code repository.

  1) Download ACE+TAO+CIAO and extract
  
  2) Set environment variables (in System Properties):
        ACE_ROOT = (ACE_wrappers directory)
        MPC_ROOT = %ACE_ROOT%\MPC
        TAO_ROOT = %ACE_ROOT%\TAO
        CIAO_ROOT = %TAO_ROOT%\CIAO
        PROTOBUF_ROOT = (protobuf-2.3.0-win-i386\ directory within your Git working directory)
        PATH = %PROTOBUF_ROOT%\bin;%ACE_ROOT%\bin;%ACE_ROOT%\lib
        
        (After setting environment variables, any open command prompts or Visual
        Studio instances must be restarted for changes to take effect.)
        
  3) Build ACE (you may also build TAO and CIAO at this point, but they are not
     currently required for the gateway):
        Open ACE_wrappers_vc9.sln from within the ACE_wrappers folder and build.
        
  4) If not already installed, download and install perl for Windows.  The DOC
     group recommends ActiveState ActivePerl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl)
     
  5) Generate the Gateway workspace:
       %ACE_ROOT\bin\mwc.pl --type vc9 Gateway.mwc
       
  6) Build the gateway:
      Open Gateway.sln in Visual Studio and build.
